### A Note on Safari

The Safari extension is not (yet) hosted on Apple's Extension Gallery. To install, [download the extension `safari.safariextz` from the `dist` folder][Safari] and open it. Since the extension is not from the Gallery, Safari will ask you to trust it.

## Limitations

If there are multiple files on the same page, a table of contents will currently only be shown for the first file. This is a rare issue and only occurs in gists but not in repos or wikis. Support for multiple files [might be added in the future](https://github.com/arthurhammer/github-toc/issues/5).

## Build Yourself

You need [`node`](https://nodejs.org/)/[`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/).

    git clone git@github.com:arthurhammer/github-toc.git # Or download zip file
    cd github-toc

    # Install development dependencies
    npm install

    # Build unpackaged extensions for testing and running locally
    npm run build

    # Build extensions packaged for distribution
    npm run dist

Packaged and unpackaged builds live in the [`dist`](dist/) folder. [`gulp`](http://gulpjs.com/) is used to run the tasks (installed with the other dependencies).

(The build system is a bit much for such a simple extension. I just wanted to try out `npm`, `gulp` and all the other things I hadn't used before.)

### Testing and Running Locally

First build the unpackaged extensions:

    npm run build

Install the extensions in the browser as described below. To try the extension out, test it on the [cases described in the `test` folder](test/Readme.md).

#### Google Chrome

- Open the extensions page in Chrome
- Choose `dist/chrome` under ‚ÄúLoad unpacked extension...‚Äù

#### Firefox

    npm run firefox

This will open a new Firefox instance with the extension installed.

#### Safari

- Open Extension Builder in Safari
- Add `dist/safari.safariextension` as existing extension
- Click ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù

Note: Unless you have a valid Safari Extension certificate, the extension will automatically be removed whenever you quit Safari. You will also not be able to build the packaged extension for direct install. [The certificate requires a (paid) Apple Developer Program membership](https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/Tools/Conceptual/SafariExtensionGuide/ExtensionsOverview/ExtensionsOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009977-CH15-SW26).

#### Userscript

Install `dist/github-toc.user.js` directly in the browser (if supported) or with your favorite userscript manager (e.g. [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net)).
